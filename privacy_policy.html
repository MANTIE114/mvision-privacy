  <h1>MVision Privacy Policy (Apple TV / tvOS Version)</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>MVision</strong>, a local music player for Apple TV (tvOS) that allows users to browse and play music stored in their own SMB network folders.</p>
  <p>We value your privacy and are committed to providing transparency about how MVision works. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app handles — and more importantly, what it does <strong>not</strong> collect.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>MVision is a standalone Apple TV (tvOS) application. It operates entirely on your device and does not connect to any external or cloud servers operated by the developer. The app is designed to play music files stored in user-selected SMB network directories within the same local network.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>MVision does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information (name, email, Apple ID, etc.)</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or analytics data</li>
    <li>Location or IP address</li>
    <li>SMB login credentials</li>
    <li>Any file metadata, song titles, or media contents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The app never sends data outside of your Apple TV device.</p>

  <h2>3. SMB Access and Local Playback</h2>
  <p>When connecting to an SMB share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The app accesses only the folders and files you choose.</li>
    <li>SMB credentials, if entered, are stored securely by the tvOS system keychain (Apple’s secure credential storage).</li>
    <li>MVision does not upload, share, or transmit any content or credentials.</li>
    <li>All playback, album art display, and lyric rendering are processed locally on your Apple TV.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>MVision does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud services. All features are implemented locally to protect your privacy.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Although MVision does not collect or transmit data, it follows Apple’s tvOS security and sandboxing standards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All file access occurs within the scope of user permission.</li>
    <li>SMB credentials are never shared or accessible to other apps.</li>
    <li>No external connections are made unless initiated by the user for SMB access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>MVision does not target children and does not collect any personal or behavioral information from any users, including minors.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements. Any changes will be published with a new “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p><strong>MVision for Apple TV</strong> is a local-only SMB music player. It does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data, playback activity, or file content. All operations occur securely on your Apple TV device.</p>
